# Personal-Dashboard-Chrome-Extension
This is a Personal Dashboard which will appear as a homepage in Chome Browser , this Dashboard gives Real time data of Cryptocurrency , weather etc.
Here I have used `HTML Geolocation API` to access the *geological* coordinates of the user and then use it to get the weather of the current location of
user using `OpenWeather API` , ``Unshplash API` to access random photos which acts as a wallpaper for our homepage , `CoinGecko API` to access Real Time 
information about the desired Coin and also a `type.fit/quotes API` to get random quotes which get displayed on the webpage. 

I have furthur added bit of CSS , and also DOM manipulation which has made this possible.
